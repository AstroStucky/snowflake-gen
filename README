=== Requirements ===
g++ 5.0 or higher
GNU Make

=== How to compile ===
Just run the make command in the same directory as this README.
It should have generated an executable "snowflakes" file.

=== How to Run ===
Use ./snowflakes --help to see arguments.
Running just the commands without arguments will geneate the default snowflake.

Since visualization is currently done by outputing a large amount of characters to
stdin, if you plan to view output in a terminal window, it is recommended that 
you zoom out several times to view the resultsing snowflakes without line wraps.

== Example snowflakes == 
Here are a few pretty examples to start exploring the snowflake parameter space.

./snowflakes -l 0.1 -a 0.0001 -d 1.0 -n 1200
./snowflakes -l 0.1 -a 0.0 -d 1.0 -n 800
./snowflakes -l 0.2 -a 0.0001 -d 1.0 -n 400
